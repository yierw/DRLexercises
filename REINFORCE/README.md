# REINDORCE


Implement 1: `noise_reduction_1.ipynb`

- Train agent to play `CartPole-v0`
- simple REINFORCE algorithm
- reduce noise by using reward-to-go
- reduce noise by using batch

Implement 1: `noise_reduction_2.ipynb`
- Train agent to play
- implement batch algorithm by parallel environment
- add reward normalization within a batch
